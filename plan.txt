- Each Access Level Except for Master Admin gets a password File. 
  We will hard code the Password for Master Admin in the program so that if some one gets the password files they still
  cant access the Master Admin. 

- We will have one File Named "StudentList.txt" which will contain the names of the students with their registration
  numbers.

- We Will have one File to store student Grades. 

  Format:
  print Test Name & How much it is graded out of

  Example:

  Ask Name of Quiz/Test: <Teacher Types Here>
  Test Out of: <Teacher Types Points Here>
			
  For Loop:		
  Print Student Name
  Points Earned: <Teacher Types Points Earned by Student>
